# Inferential Linear Regression
In many cases, linear regressions performance as a predictive model is comperable to it's more complex counterparts.  Linear regression is highly favorable when it comes to a tool for inferential analysis.

## Objectives
 - Understand the assumptions of the linear regression model:
    - Observations are independent
    - Errors have constant conditional variance
    - Errors are normally distributed
 - Understand the use for p-values associated with beta coefficients 
 - Interpret Beta coefficients to gain insight into the relationship between variables.
