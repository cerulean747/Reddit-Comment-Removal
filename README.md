# reddit-comment-removal

Reddit is a website that aggregates news and social content and provides a platform for discussion. Although basically any topic can be discussed on Reddit, the site is heavily moderated. Users report offensive/abusive comments or comments that otherwise violate subreddit rules to moderators, who then review these comments and decide whether or not to remove them. 

For this project, I’d like to predict whether or not comments from Reddit’s PoliticalDiscussion subreddit will be removed, in order to potentially reduce the amount of user and moderator work.
