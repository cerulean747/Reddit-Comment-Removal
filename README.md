# Inferential Linear Regression
In many cases, linear regressions performance as a predictive model is comperable to it's more complex counterparts.  Linear regression is highly favorable when it comes to a tool for inferential analysis.

## Objectives
 - Understand the assumptions of the linear regression model:
    - Observations are independent
    - Errors have constant conditional variance
    - Errors are normally distributed
 - Understand the use for p-values associated with beta coefficients 
 - Interpret Beta coefficients to gain insight into the relationship between variables.

# Spark Dataframes

Spark dataframes are the most efficient way of using pyspark to manipulate formatted distributed data. The structure also allows you to leverage SQL syntax, so there are options for data manipulation regardless of which scheme you prefer.
